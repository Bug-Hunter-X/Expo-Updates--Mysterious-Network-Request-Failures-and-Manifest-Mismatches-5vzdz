# Expo Updates Debugging: Uncommon Network Request Failures

This repository demonstrates a common yet challenging issue when deploying updates with `expo-updates`. The error manifests as vague network requests failing, lacking detailed diagnostics to pinpoint the root cause.  This example showcases the problem and its solution.

## Problem
The core problem is a mismatch between the update's manifest (serving update information) and the Expo client's expectations. This can be due to incorrect URLs, corrupted manifest data, intermittent network issues, or temporary Expo server problems.

## Solution
The solution involves several steps:
1. **Verify Update URL:** Double-check the URL provided to `expo-updates` for accuracy. It's common to introduce typos or incorrect paths.
2. **Inspect Manifest Data:** Examine the structure and contents of the manifest file. Ensure it's correctly formatted JSON with all required fields.
3. **Network Monitoring:** Utilize browser developer tools or network monitoring tools to capture and analyze the network requests made during the update process.  Look for error codes or unusual responses.
4. **Expo CLI:** Ensure you are using the latest version of Expo CLI, and re-deploy frequently to ensure compatibility.
5. **Check Expo Status:**  Consult the Expo status page to see if any known outages or issues could be affecting your deployments.
