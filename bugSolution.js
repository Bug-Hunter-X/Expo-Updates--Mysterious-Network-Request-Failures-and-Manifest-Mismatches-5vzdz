The solution involves a combination of careful verification, thorough testing, and using debugging tools.

**1. Verify the Update URL:**
Ensure that the URL you're using in your Expo app for fetching updates is accurate.  Common mistakes are typos or incorrect file paths.

**2. Inspect the Manifest:**
Carefully review the manifest file (usually a JSON file) associated with your Expo update. Check for any structural errors, missing keys, or unexpected values that could cause a mismatch.

**3. Network Debugging:**
Use your browser's developer tools (Network tab) or a dedicated network monitoring tool to capture and analyze the HTTP requests made during the update process. Look for error codes or anything that seems unusual. Note the full response content.  This provides critical clues about the nature of the failure. 

**4. Check the Expo Status:**
Before you jump to deep technical analysis, verify that the Expo service is functional. Sometimes temporary server-side issues can cause these types of problems. 

**5. Retry and Redeploy:**
In some situations, temporary network glitches or server-side issues might cause temporary failures. Try again after a short delay, and, if necessary, re-deploy your update to ensure everything is properly published.
