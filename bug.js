This error occurs when using the `expo-updates` package and deploying updates to your Expo app. The error message might not be very descriptive, such as `Network request failed`, or it might not provide enough context for debugging.  The issue stems from a mismatch between the update's manifest and the client's expectation. This mismatch can be caused by several factors, including incorrect update URLs, incorrect manifest data, network issues during the update check, or problems with the Expo servers themselves.
